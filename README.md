Detect faces and key points of anime characters 

Training data is obtained from [These Waifus Do Not Exist](https://www.obormot.net/demos/these-waifus-do-not-exist-alt) , the model had been trained for 12 hours on GTX 1080ti and reached a accuracy of 96%

Because the images on [These Waifus Do Not Exist](https://www.obormot.net/demos/these-waifus-do-not-exist-alt) 
 are all avatars so the model will be not that accuracy when  playing on the whole body image. However as i also upload checkpoints, you can continue to train if you want better accuracy or full-body detection.
